# CarnotCycles.jl

Documentation of CarnotCycles.jl.

The goal of this package is to have a basic acausal framework to model thermodynamic cycles.

This package combines [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) "Acausal Modeling" with [CoolProp.jl](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp.jl) and [Clapyeron.jl](https://github.com/ClapeyronThermo/Clapeyron.jl). 

The themodynamic components are modelled as steady state components. All the componenets are based on the laws of thermodynamics.
